1. Draw a custom Question mark logo (have some other place holder for now)

2. Authorized only (Fran and Me) pages related to planning or date ideas and what not 

3. Remember those TikToks where it's like "if you know your partner which would they choose", and 
    there could be lots of different categories for this.I'm thinking first the one person chooses which
    options they would pick clicking pictures and what not for the options in the theme. And then it becomes the 
    parterns turn where they see like 4 options for each question that the first person was choosing from
    and they have to pick which one they think their parter would want/pick. This could lead to a fun
    "get to know" your parter or even reinforce the bond both have because they do indeed know eachother 
    very well.
